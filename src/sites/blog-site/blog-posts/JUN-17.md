I'd like to share a recent project with you. This particular project was to redesign [UIE.com](https://www.uie.com/) (currently the live implementation of my work, 06-17-20) my company's landing page, at the time, to reflect modern web practices. Our goal was to create a page that helped usher user's to the product that fit them or they were looking for. I'll walk you through my process as the lead on this project. This will part I of a series of posts about this project, bringing you from design to testing and eventual implementation.


##Project Goals
For my intern project at UIE, I was given the opportunity to redesign the company's home page. The goal of the project was to create a new home page that was up to modern standards and would help customers find the product that was right for them. I created sketches, mockups, prototypes, and eventually the final implementation. Along the way I learned about user testing and UX design in general.


##Sketching
The start of the process had me and the other intern creating sketches for possible designs. We knew of certain constraints to base the design around. Alongside this project we created a problem statement, scenarios, and goals we had for the project. These components would help us navigate our challenges going forward.

##Mockups
As our team met and discussed our design direction further, I began to create higher fidelity mockups in photoshop. Using my experience with the tool Adobe Photoshop, I was able to try out different solutions quickly. After practicing with html mockups and photoshop mockups, I think I'm leaning towards html/css mockups being a faster and more rewarding process.

##Content and User Testing
As our design direction became more focused, and we had a mockup that represented the direction we were headed, we wanted to start answering some questions we had. To do this, we held two rounds of user testing sessions with UX designers as participants. We wanted answers to questions like: Is the red too distracting? Is there too much copy? Does this design help the user understand what our products are? After over 12 user testing sessions, we gathered all of our observations and analyzed them in a meeting based on the [KJ Technique](https://articles.uie.com/kj_technique/). This final process gave us answers and solutions that we were able to then implement.

##HTML Prototype
During discussion, we decided to create our new landing page using html/css and Wordpress. The reasoning behind wordpress was to enable marketing and web specialists to update and arrange our card based design. This would allow us to quickly react to user feedback and focus on the most important events at a given time. I began this process by creating the prototype in plain html and css. I learned a lot about best practices and media queries from this section.

We've still got a bit to talk about concerning this project, part II will be coming soon.
