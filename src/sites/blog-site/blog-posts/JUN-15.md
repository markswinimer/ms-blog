Welcome to my first blog post! I'm Mark Swinimer, a web developer in the Boston area. I've wanted to create a blog as a personal space to exercise and reflect on the work I'm doing and the new technologies I'm learning. There are lots of things I've learned on my journey to share.

An introduction to kick things off. Growing up, I gravitated towards adventure and fantasy, and I looked in every corner I could find it. Video games provided so many opportunities to experience this and it's my love for video games that got me interested in tech. Like many a nerd, I wanted to make a video game myself. I fantasized about being a game developer and creating whatever I envisioned. Turns out deciding to learn game development to create a game is a mountainous task, as my 12 year old self discovered. At one point I had decided to learn C++ to build my own framework, something I wanted to happen overnight. It was the wrong way to go about things and it wasn't until later on in college that I'd fall in love with web development and design.

In studying graphic design at college I brushed up against web development and slowly it took over my interest. I began learning html/css and creating basic websites for myself. I found tutorials for Java online and begun teaching myself the language. I was creating blackjack and mock banking applications shortly after. I was hooked and knew this new hobby would eventually become my career.

##Launch Academy
In 2017-2018 I attended the Boston Based tech boot camp [Launch Academy](https://launchacademy.com/). Launch Academy was a 4-month full-time on campus program that had me learning full stack web development alongside a group of like-minded developers. I saw others experiencing the delights and the struggles of learning to code. My cohort-mates and I learned together, troubleshot problems with each other, and collaborated on functional web apps. Concepts like peer programming, brainstorming sessions, and hackathons brought me further into the world of development.

My capstone project for launch academy was a full stack web application, [Nerd Words](http://nerdwordsapp.herokuapp.com/). It was a word library creation and sharing application for use with games like Pictionary and Taboo. It is meant to be used in place of physical card decks, enabling you to customize these games to match you and your friends interests. It also had the ability to share and collect other's libraries. I created this initial project in two weeks and it was so exciting to see something I envisioned brought to life and fully functional.

##Internship at UIE
After Launch Academy, I accepted a paid internship at [User Interface Engineering](https://www.uie.com/) (UIE), a User Experience coaching company. We supported [Jared Spool](https://twitter.com/jmspool) in the creating and hosting of UX workshops and resources. UIE also offered an online video education service, the All You Can Learn Library. During my internship here I helped update live sites, conference websites, and created and managed html emails and the marketing of them. 

For my final project at UIE I pitched the redesign of our outdated landing page. I was given the go ahead and lead the redesign and implementation of the [new landing page](https://www.uie.com/). This was a weeks long project that encompassed designs and mockups, user testing of the potential design, and coding and implementation of the site with cross-browser and platform optimization. The site was created in Wordpress with some PHP.

##What I'm working on now
Currently I'm creating and tinkering with personal projects while continuing to learn new javascript libraries like React, Gatsby, and Node. I have a project in the works that I'm looking into hosting as an actual service, which is exciting. A list of the projects I've commited work to in the passed few months:

+ [Nerd Words Node Redesign](https://nerd-words.herokuapp.com/)
+ [Portfolio Site](https://www.markswinimer.com/)
+ [Blog Site](https://www.markswinimer.com/blog)
+ Various tutorial projects
    + Node task manager app
    + React color picker app
+ Game development
    - Learning Game Maker Studio 2
    - GML language

I plan to make individual blog posts to talk about and detail each of these projects in time. Reflecting and talking about these projects has been really helpful in the understanding and retention of the technologies.

Well, that's the bare minimum introduction of my work history and how I got into web development. I'm planning for the future blog posts to go more into the coding and design of projects I work on. I'd also like to reflect on the libraries I'm learning as well as create explanation posts for bugs and difficulties I've solved along the way.

Thanks for reading!
